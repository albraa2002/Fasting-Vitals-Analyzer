Fasting-Vitals-Analyzer
A Medical Informatics ML project analyzing the physiological impacts of fasting using Random Forest and Plotly.
 ⚡ Fasting Vitals Analyzer & Predictor

📌 Project Overview
As part of my Medical Informatics focus, this project bridges Healthcare and Data Science. It simulates, analyzes, and predicts the physiological impacts of continuous fasting (such as Intermittent Fasting or Ramadan) on the human body using Machine Learning and Interactive Data Visualization.

 🚀 Key Features
Synthetic Data Generation: Created a realistic medical dataset for 500 patients, tracking Baseline vs. Current Weight, Fasting Blood Sugar, Sleep Quality, and Fasting Hours.
  Predictive Modeling (Machine Learning): Trained a Random Forest Regressor to predict weight loss based on age, fasting duration, and baseline weight. 
  Model Performance: Achieved an excellent R² Score of 0.86** and a minimal RMSE (0.16 kg).
  Feature Importance Analysis: Extracted insights proving that Days Fasted (83%) is the dominant factor in weight reduction.
  Interactive UI/UX Dashboard: Developed a dark-themed, highly interactive Plotly HTML dashboard to visualize medical KPIs, trends, and patient distributions.

 🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x
  Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
  Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn (Random Forest Regressor)
  Data Visualization: Plotly (Express & Graph Objects)

 📊 Dashboard Highlights
1. Medical KPIs: Average Weight Loss, Blood Sugar Drop, and Daily Fasting Window.
2. Effect of Fasting Duration on Weight Loss: A scatter plot with trendlines showing the correlation across genders.
3. Blood Sugar Distribution: A box plot comparing Baseline vs. After-Fasting blood sugar levels.
4. Driver Analysis: A bar chart illustrating the Random Forest feature importances.
